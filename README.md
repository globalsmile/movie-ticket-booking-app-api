# Movie Ticket Booking App RESTful API

A fully functional RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing movie listings, showtimes, seat bookings, and more. This project implements features like data validation with Joi, email notifications via Mailgun, media uploads using Cloudinary, and comprehensive testing with Jest, Supertest, and MongoDB Memory Server. The API is documented with Postman and can be deployed on platforms like Render.com.

## Repository Setup and Branching

### Cloning and Creating a New Repository

1. **Clone the Existing Repository into a New Directory:**

```bash
   git clone <old-repo-url> movie-ticket-booking-api
   cd movie-ticket-booking-api
```

2. **Remove the Old Remote to Prevent Accidental Pushes:**

```
git remote remove origin
```

3. **Create a New Repository on GitHub and add the new remote:**

```
git remote add origin <new-repo-url>
```

**Branching Strategy**
- **Feature Branches:**
  - Develop new features on separate branches (e.g., feature/validation-joi).

- **Development Branch:**
  - Merge feature branches into a development branch for integration and testing:

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b development
git push -u origin development
```

- **Main Branch:**
  - After thorough testing on development, merge changes into main:

```
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
```

## **Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/movie-booking

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# Mailgun (Email Notifications)
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_private_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@yourdomain.com

# Cloudinary (Media Uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```

Make sure to configure these variables in your production environment as well.

## **Setup Instructions**
- Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies:

```
git clone <new-repo-url>
cd movie-ticket-booking-api
npm install
```

- Set Up Environment Variables:
- Create a .env file (as shown above).
- Run the Application Locally:

Refer to the Postman Documentation for detailed request and response examples.

## **Third-Party Integrations**
### **Mailgun for Email Notifications**
  - Emails are sent using Mailgun. In production, configure Mailgun by storing your API key and domain as environment variables. The email utility (src/utils/email.js) handles sending emails for account creation, password resets, and changes.

### **Cloudinary for Media Uploads**
  - Cloudinary is configured in src/config/cloudinary.js using environment variables. Instructors can upload media files via the /api/courses/:courseId/upload endpoint. This setup uses multer and multer-storage-cloudinary for file handling.

## **Postman Documentation**
  - Import the Collection:
    - Import the provided Postman collection JSON file into Postman.

- **Publish the Documentation:**

- Open the collection in Postman.
- Click on "View Documentation" and then "Publish".
- Copy the generated public URL and include it in the README or share it with your team.


## **API Documentation**

## **Deployment**
This API is deployed on Render at  https://advanced-e-learning-api.onrender.com. Deployment steps include:

- Push Code to GitHub:
  - Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the new GitHub repository.

- Configure Render.com:
  - Connect the repository.

- Set environment variables (as shown above) in Render’s dashboard.
- Deploy the application.
- Update Postman Base URL:
- In your Postman collection, update the {{baseUrl}} variable to the production URL provided by Render.

## **Troubleshooting**
- 502 Bad Gateway Errors:
  - Check server logs and ensure that environment variables (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.) are correctly configured. Verify that the application is listening on the correct port.

- 500 Internal Server Errors on Upload:
  - Verify Cloudinary configuration, file size limits, and allowed formats. Wrap your upload route in a try-catch block to log detailed error messages.

- Mailgun Errors:
  - Ensure that the "to" field is populated with a valid email address and that your Mailgun credentials are correct.

- JWT or JOI Validation Issues:
  - Confirm that your JWT secret is consistently used across signing and verification. Review JOI schemas for correctness.
